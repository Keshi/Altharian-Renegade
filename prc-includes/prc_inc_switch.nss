 /*

 Creating your personal switch settings
 For singleplayer, you can create a 2da file and place it in the overide
 Then via the PRC Options switch you can read that 2da and it will
 use it to set switches for you.
 This will not work in multiplayer.
 An example is below. Copy and paste it into a plain text file saved
 as personal_switch.2da

 If there is a file named personal_switch.2da then it will be loaded
 at module load and the switches set accordingly.
